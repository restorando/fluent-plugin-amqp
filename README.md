# AMQP output plugin for Fluentd

Fluentd output plugin to publish events to an amqp broker.

Events are published one by one using the Fluentd tag as the routing key, in JSON format like:

```javascript
{ "key": "fluentd-tag", "timestamp": "fluentd-timestamp", "payload": "event-payload" }
```

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fluent-plugin-amqp2
